The first Armory3D competition has ended. Time to turn in your projects and vote!

## Armory Community Game Competition #1 - Voting

The competition has ended and if you haven't posted your competition game entry yet? Hurry up! Due to unforeseen technical errors with the forum registration system, the voting will be postponed for 3 days. In case you're not able to create a user here, you can still participate by:

## Method one:

Showcase your game on Discord (https://discord.gg/ccQyuHP) in the "Showcase" channel. Remember to post at least 2 pictures of your project and remember to write that it's for the Armory3D Community Game Competition.

## Method two:

Make a github (https://github.com/) repo with your game and post some images and description in the readme.md (default text) file. Make sure that the repo name starts with "ACGC_" so I can find it.

## Method three:

Post it in this forum's showcase section.
Included just to clarify. This is the recommended method, although as mentioned it might not be possible for everyone due to the registration problems.

## Method four:

This is the least recommended method, but if everything else fails: Send me a DM on twitter @ NaxelaKleemann

---

At the end, I will try to compile up all entries in one thread along with a competition poll. You will need a user to be able to cast your vote.

A voting thread will be made on thursday (4th of june), and the voting will run for a week. Remember to vote! Although if there's only one competition entry, then that's an automatic win!
